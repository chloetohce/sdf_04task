public class FileInputStream
extends InputStream
A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available depends on the host environment.
FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.
API Note:
The close() method should be called to release resources used by this stream, either directly, or with the try-with-resources statement.
Implementation Requirements:
Subclasses are responsible for the cleanup of resources acquired by the subclass. Subclasses requiring that resource cleanup take place after a stream becomes unreachable should use Cleaner or some other mechanism.
