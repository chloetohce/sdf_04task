public class DataInputStream
extends FilterInputStream
implements DataInput
A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream.
A DataInputStream is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If a DataInputStream is to be used by more than one thread then access to the data input stream should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.
