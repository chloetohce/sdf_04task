public final class Byte
extends Number
implements Comparable<Byte>, Constable
The Byte class wraps a value of primitive type byte in an object. An object of type Byte contains a single field whose type is byte.
In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a byte to a String and a String to a byte, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a byte.

This is a value-based class; programmers should treat instances that are equal as interchangeable and should not use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
